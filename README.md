# Genesis

Demo:

This demo is similar to the QuestDemo but shows sprite support with the spinning gold coin using the new Animated Sprite constructor.
The demo also has the inital code for the Game Controller wrapper. For now, it prints out when you press the A or B button in the terminal.

Instructions:

```
make
./bin/myGame
```
