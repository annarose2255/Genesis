*Movement*
WASD to move Player
Up/Down/Left/Right to move camera 

4.17.20 - Alpha Build 
- Something weird going on with tweening, so move Player in beginning to see it
- Room 5 and Room 7 built (Starts at Room 7, move all the way left to go to Room 5)
- In Battle: Run into enemy to start battle; Use 'N' and 'M' to toggle selection, 'Enter' to select, 'Backspace' to go back
- abilities cannot be used at this time therefore once, 'Flee' is selected, the enemy disappears, simulating what would happen if it is captured/killed.
