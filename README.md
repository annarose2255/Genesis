*Battle*
-Run into an enemy to start battle
-Use [N] and [M] to toggle selection; [Enter] to make selection
-Attack: usable
-enemies will either attack, use an ability, or block. block reduces incoming damage by half. Abilites programed are currently jump and ghost (jump avoids damage from next attack and ghost avoids damage for the next two attacks). It is a 33% chance which is choosen, however blocks cannot be used 3 times in a row. When an enemy uses an ability, they have a number of turns where that ability is active and a number of turns where they need to wait before using a ability again. Durning this time, the likelyhood the enemies will attack is 65% with a 35% chance of blocking. 
-Flee: exit battle
